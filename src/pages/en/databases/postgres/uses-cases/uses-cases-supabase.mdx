Postgres database supports other types of connections as in this case it is Supabase, let's take a quick tour on the Supabase platform to get our database credentials

The first thing is to create your account if you don't have one yet [Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-in?returnTo=%2Fsign-in) account.
Log in with your Github user

The second thing is to create an organization which is the one that allows you to create projects, this part is intuitive, create one then the other
The database will ask you for a strong key, copy it and save it in a safe place, you will need it later for the connection :)

Once we have our database ready, the next thing is to go to the project configuration section
