# Baileys Provider

The [Baileys](https://whiskeysockets.github.io/Baileys/) library originated as a project for CS-2362 at 
[Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/courses/mathematics-and-computer-science/) and is not affiliated
 with or endorsed by WhatsApp. Use it at your own discretion and avoid spamming individuals. We discourage 
 the use of stalkerware, bulk messaging, or any automated messaging practices.

<strong>[Baileys](https://whiskeysockets.github.io/Baileys/) is a free WhatsApp provider</strong> that operates
 via WhatsApp Web. It interacts directly with WhatsApp Web using a WebSocket and does not require Selenium or any
  other browser. By avoiding Selenium or Chromium, Baileys conserves significant RAM resources.

<Note>
 Avoid using buttons and lists as they are not fully compatible. While they may display on some devices, they often fail to function as intended.
